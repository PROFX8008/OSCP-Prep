### GDB Server

* setting up a gdb server can be very useful for embedded systems.
* it is nice to have plugins for gdb like GEF that you cannot bring with you on the embedded system. This is a good use case for gdb-server and then connecting with your gdb client which can have the plugins you want to assist VR
* start the server attaching to a process that is running

```
./gdbserver-7.12-mips-be 0.0.0.0:65000 --attach 204
Attached; pid = 204
Listening on port 65000
```

* connect with your client&#x20;

<pre><code>gdb
target remote 192.168.15.7:65000
Remote debugging using 192.168.15.7:65000
<strong>--snip--
</strong>[*] Failed to find objfile or not a valid file format: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/proc/204/root/nova/bin/login'
Invalid hex digit 59
</code></pre>

* you can now run all your normal gdb commands!
