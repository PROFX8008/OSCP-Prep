# Processes Threads Handles

### Processes&#x20;

* An instance of an executable&#x20;
* Think of it as a container&#x20;
* An application can have many processes i.e. your web browser
  * each tab you open will spawn a new processes&#x20;
* A Process typically isnt aware of other processes on the machine
  * It believes it is the only process on the machine
* Each processes is started with a single thread, often called `primary thread` but can create additional threads from any of its threads&#x20;

#### Three Types of Processes&#x20;

* Application Processes&#x20;
  * i.e chrome is an application process&#x20;
  * Can be terminated by the user
* Background processes&#x20;
  * Get started automatically&#x20;
  * updating software&#x20;
  * anti viruses&#x20;
* Windows Processes
  * system level processes&#x20;
  * automatically get launched at start up&#x20;
    * device drivers&#x20;
    * windows memory management&#x20;

### Process Priority&#x20;

* determines the amount of CPU time each processes will be allocated&#x20;
* there are 6 different levels&#x20;
  * Realtime
  * High&#x20;
  * Above normal&#x20;
  * Normal&#x20;
  * Below normal&#x20;
  * Low&#x20;

#### Low&#x20;

* only be given cpu time when there are no other higher priority processes running on the system

#### Normal&#x20;

* by default normal is used for the creation of a processes&#x20;
  * NORMAL\_PRIORITY\_CLASS

#### Realtime

* full access to the cpu&#x20;
* very dangerous as this is higher than disk cache, mouse, keyboard&#x20;
* will leave no cycles for anything else&#x20;

### Threads&#x20;

* a thread is the entity within a processes that can be scheduled for execution&#x20;
* All threads of a process share its virtual address space and system resources&#x20;
* Process can have many threads&#x20;
  * also called multi threading&#x20;

### Differences Processes and Threads

* processes use much more resources&#x20;
* threads are lightweight&#x20;
* processes are a team trying to complete a project&#x20;
* thread is a single member of the team working on a part of a project&#x20;
* processes are independent of each other&#x20;
* threads are dependent on each other&#x20;

### Handle&#x20;

* Generic unit of identification&#x20;
* pointer to our object&#x20;
* many different types of handles&#x20;
  * the most common one is handles to processes and handles to modules&#x20;
* handles are system wide&#x20;
