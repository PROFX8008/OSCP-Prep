Git-Book of this Repo:

### Red Team Quality of Life Scripts

#### Clipboard monitor&#x20;

* Never be unsure of what is in your clipboard buffer again

{% file src=".gitbook/assets/clip.py" %}

```
//create small window and run with
python3 clip.py
```

#### Scripted Window

* Have you ever neglected to take notes on an important engagement, or forgotten to save off a key command?  scriptme.py will solve those issues.  Personally I much prefer this solution to the built in script command.
