# Windows Registry

## Folder/predefined key

### `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`

* Contains the root of the configuration information for the user who is currently logged on.
* The user's folders, screen colors, and Control Panel settings are stored here. This information is associated with the user's profile.
* This key is sometimes abbreviated as `HKCU`.

### `HKEY_USERS`

* Contains all the actively loaded user profiles on the computer. `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` is a subkey of `HKEY_USERS`. `HKEY_USERS` is sometimes abbreviated as `HKU`.

### `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`

* Contains configuration information particular to the computer (for any user). This key is sometimes abbreviated as `HKLM`.

### `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`

* Is a subkey of `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software`. The information that is stored here makes sure that the correct program opens when you open a file by using Windows Explorer.
* This key is sometimes abbreviated as `HKCR`.
* Starting with Windows 2000, this information is stored under both the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` and `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` keys. The `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes` key contains default settings that can apply to all users on the local computer.
* The `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes` key has settings that override the default settings and apply only to the interactive user.
* The `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT` key provides a view of the registry that merges the information from these two sources.
* `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT` also provides this merged view for programs that are designed for earlier versions of Windows.
* To change the settings for the interactive user, changes must be made under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes` instead of under HKEY\_CLASSES\_ROOT.
* To change the default settings, changes must be made under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes` .If you write keys to a key under `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`, the system stores the information under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes`.
* If you write values to a key under `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`, and the key already exists under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes`, the system will store the information there instead of under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes`.

### `HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG`

* Contains information about the hardware profile that is used by the local computer at system startup.

## Accessing registry hives offline

* If you are accessing a live system, you will be able to access the registry using `regedit.exe`, and you will be greeted with all of the standard root keys we learned about in the previous task.
* However, if you only have access to a disk image, you must know where the registry hives are located on the disk. The majority of these hives are located in the `C:\Windows\System32\Config` directory and are:
* `DEFAULT` (mounted on `HKEY_USERS\DEFAULT`)
* `SAM` (mounted on `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM`)
* `SECURITY` (mounted on `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Security`)
* `SOFTWARE` (mounted on `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software`)
* `SYSTEM` (mounted on `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System`)
* Hives containing user information:
* Apart from these hives, two other hives containing user information can be found in the User profile directory. For Windows 7 and above, a userâ€™s profile directory is located in `C:\Users\<username>\` where the hives are:
* `NTUSER.DAT` (mounted on `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` when a user logs in)
* `USRCLASS.DAT` (mounted on `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\CLASSES`)
* The `USRCLASS.DAT` hive is located in the directory `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows`.
* The `NTUSER.DAT` hive is located in the directory `C:\Users\<username>\`.
* Remember that NTUSER.DAT and USRCLASS.DAT are hidden files.

## The Amcache Hive:

* Apart from these files, there is another very important hive called the `AmCache` hive.
* This hive is located in `C:\Windows\AppCompat\Programs\Amcache.hve`. Windows creates this hive to save information on programs that were recently run on the system.

### Great Keys to Enumerate

* Capture the output from these commands and save off. Will tell you alot about the system + give you further places to dig&#x20;
