# FTP Pentesting

### Identification&#x20;

* Many different types of FTP server&#x20;
* Nmap scan results&#x20;

```
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     Microsoft ftpd
```

* Before connecting ensure that the directory you are in (on your local machine is writable, or else you will not be able to download anything off the remote ftp server&#x20;

### FTP Anonymous Login

```
ftp <ip>
username: anomyous
password: <enter>
```

* If successful it will let you know you successfully logged in and might tell you the OS

```
230 User logged in.
Remote system type is Windows_NT.
```

* Attempt to download and also place files. &#x20;
* Start with attempting to just place a text file with some words&#x20;
* If the file name has spaces, be sure to escape the space character&#x20;

```
#anonymous login allowed
02-28-22  07:36PM       <DIR>          Nadine
02-28-22  07:37PM       <DIR>          Nathan
ftp> cd Nadine
ftp> get Confidential.txt
ftp> cd Nathan
ftp> get Notes\ to\ do.txt

```

### Brute Force&#x20;

Good wordlist for FTP brute [https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials/ftp-betterdefaultpasslist.txt](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/blob/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials/ftp-betterdefaultpasslist.txt)

### Automated Scanning

Anon login and bounce FTP checks are perform by default by nmap with **-sC** option or:

```bash
nmap --script ftp-* -p 21 <ip>
```

### Passive FTP&#x20;

* If a client machine has a firewall up, then Active FTP will create issues
* Connect like normal to the ftp server&#x20;
* Once connected have your first command be:

```
passv
#or
passive
```

* This will switch the FTP client server connection to passive move and allow you to operate as normal.

### Downloading Files

* To download one file use:

```
get filename.txt 
```

* To download everything in a specific directory use:

```
mget *
```

### Put Files

* To upload a file to the ftp server use:

```
put filename.txt 
#or 
mput filename.txt
```

### Other Considerations

* If there is also a web server, it is possible that the same directories accessible on the ftp server are hosted on the web server
* For example if on the ftp server there is a directory called `scripts`, attempt to see if there is a directory on the web server called scripts.
* This will allow for an easy web shell upload, which can then be executed via the web server.
