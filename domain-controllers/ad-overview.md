# AD Overview

### Windows Domain

* A Windows Domain is a group of user and computers under the administration of a business.
* Centralizes the administration of common windows components
* Stores it all in a centralized repo called Active Directory
* The server that runs AD is called a Domain Controller

### Advantages to Domains

* Centralized Identity Management - All users across the network can be configured from AD with minimum effort
* Managing Security Policies - You can configure security policies from AD and apply them to users and computers across the network&#x20;

### AD DS

* Active Directory Domain Service (AD DS) is at the core of every domain
* This service is a catalogue that holds all the information of the "objects" that exist in your network
* In terms of objects there are users, groups, machines, printers, shares, etc, etc

#### Users

* Users are one of the objects known as security principles&#x20;
* Means they can be authenticated by the domain and can be assigned privileges over a resource like a file or printer
* Security Principles can act upon a resource in a network&#x20;

#### People vs Services&#x20;

* Users can represent two types of entities&#x20;
  * People: users will generally represent peoples that need to access a network&#x20;
  * Services: you can difine users to be used by services i.e. IIS, MSSQL
* Every service requires a user to run but services differ from regular users as they will only have the privileges needed to run their specific service

#### Machines

* Machines are another type of object in a domain.
* For every computer that joins AD a machine object will be recreated
* Machines are considered Security Principles&#x20;
* They are assigned an account just like a user&#x20;
* This account has limited rights within the domain itself&#x20;
* The machine accounts themselves are local administrators on the assigned computer
* They are generally not supposed to be accessed by anyone except the computer itself&#x20;
* But if you have the password you can use them&#x20;
* Machine account passwords are automatically rotated out and are generally comprised of 120 random chars&#x20;

#### Identify Machine Accounts&#x20;

* They are easy to identify&#x20;
* They follow a specific naming scheme&#x20;
* Machine account name is the computer name followed by a $&#x20;
* i.e. if the computer name is `SRV01` the machine account is `SRV01$`&#x20;

#### Security Groups&#x20;

* You can define user groups to assign access rights to files and other resources to a group vice a user&#x20;
* Security groups are also considered security principals and can have privileges over resources on a network&#x20;

#### Default Domain Groups&#x20;

| Security Group     | Description                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Domain Admins      | Users of this group have administrative privileges over the entire domain. By default, they can administer any computer on the domain, including the DCs. |
| Server Operators   | Users in this group can administer Domain Controllers. They cannot change any administrative group memberships.                                           |
| Backup Operators   | Users in this group are allowed to access any file, ignoring their permissions. They are used to perform backups of data on computers.                    |
| Account Operators  | Users in this group can create or modify other accounts in the domain.                                                                                    |
| Domain Users       | Includes all existing user accounts in the domain.                                                                                                        |
| Domain Computers   | Includes all existing computers in the domain.                                                                                                            |
| Domain Controllers | Includes all existing DCs on the domain.                                                                                                                  |

### AD Users and Computers&#x20;

* To config users or groups or machines in AD we need to log into the DC and run `Active Directory Users and Computers`&#x20;
* This is located on the start menu&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/11d01963392078c1450300d2881f9160.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Will open a hierarchy of users, computers and groups that exist in a domain&#x20;
* They are all organized in `Organizational Units` `OUs`
* These are contain objects that allow you to classify users and machines&#x20;
* OUs are mainly used to define sets of users with similar policing requirements&#x20;
* Users can be a part of a single OU at a time&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/c5b1d321108bc065771eba62d24f5e83.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* If you open any of the OUs you can see the users they contain
* This is where you can create, delete or modify them as needed
* Can also reset passwords here

### Default Containers&#x20;

* There are default containers in domains&#x20;
* Created by windows automatically&#x20;
  * **Builtin:** Contains default groups available to any Windows host.
  * **Computers:** Any machine joining the network will be put here by default. You can move them if needed.
  * **Domain Controllers:** Default OU that contains the DCs in your network.
  * **Users:** Default users and groups that apply to a domain-wide context.
  * **Managed Service Accounts:** Holds accounts used by services in your Windows domain.

### Security Groups vs OUs

* OUs - handy for applying policies to users and computers&#x20;
  * Include specific configs that pertain to sets of users depending on their particular role&#x20;
  * Users can only be a member of a single OU at a time
  * Cant apply two different policies to the same user&#x20;
* Security Groups&#x20;
  * Used to grant permissions over resources&#x20;
  * If you use groups and want to allow some users to have access over a shared folder&#x20;
  * Users can be in many groups at the same time

### Deleting extra OUs and users

* OUs are protected against accidential deletion&#x20;
* To delete them enable `Advanced Features` in the `View` menu
*

    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/15b282b6e3940f4c26c477a8c21f8266.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
* This will show you some more containers and enable you to toggle the accidental deletion protection on or off.&#x20;

### Delegation

* You can and should give specific users some control over some OUs&#x20;
* This is known as delegation and it allows specific privileges to perform advanced tasks on OUs without needing a DA to step in&#x20;
* One common example is granting `IT` Staff the ability to reset other low privilege users passwords&#x20;

#### How to Delegate

* To delegate control over an OU right click and select Delegate Control&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/74f8d615658a03aeb1cfdb6767d0a0a3.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* This should open a new window where you should input the users name that you want to delegate to&#x20;
* Use the check names box to avoid a miss type&#x20;
*

* Now you can see a new window that allows more granular delegation controls&#x20;

### AD Password Resets Powershell

```
PS C:\Users\phillip> Set-ADAccountPassword sophie -Reset -NewPassword (Read-Host -AsSecureString -Prompt 'New Password') -Verbose

New Password: *********

VERBOSE: Performing the operation "Set-ADAccountPassword" on target "CN=Sophie,OU=Sales,OU=THM,DC=thm,DC=local".
```

* Now make sure to force the user to update their password on next login so they dont keep using a password that we know!

```
PS C:\Users\phillip> Set-ADUser -ChangePasswordAtLogon $true -Identity sophie -Verbose

VERBOSE: Performing the operation "Set" on target "CN=Sophie,OU=Sales,OU=THM,DC=thm,DC=local".
```
